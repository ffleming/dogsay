| Every one says that politicians lie  |
|  all the time, and that just isn't   |
|                 so!                  |
|  But you do have to understand body  |
| language to know when they're lying  |
|                 and                  |
|          when they aren't.           |
|                                      |
| When a politician rubs his nose, he  |
|             isn't lying.             |
|  When a politician tugs on his ear,  |
|           he isn't lying.            |
|   When a politician scratches his    |
|     collar bone, he isn't lying.     |
|    When his mouth starts moving,     |
|       that's when he's lying!        |
