| Like my parents, I have never been a |
| regular church member or churchgoer. |
| It doesn't seem plausible to me that |
| there is the kind of God who watches |
|    over human affairs, listens to    |
|  prayers, and tries to guide people  |
|              to follow               |
|  His precepts -- there is just too   |
| much misery and cruelty for that. On |
|                 the                  |
|  other hand, I respect and envy the  |
|   people who get inspiration from    |
|                their                 |
|              religions.              |
|          -- Benjamin Spock           |
