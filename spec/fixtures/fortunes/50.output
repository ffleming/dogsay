|   Once he had one leg in the White   |
| House and the nation trembled under  |
|                 his                  |

|                behind                |
|         the railroad yards."         |

|      Tennessee's anti-evolution      |
|   law at the Scopes "Monkey Trial"   |
|               in 1925.               |
