|  What I Did During My Fall Semester  |
|     On the first day of my fall      |
|         semester, I got up.          |
| Then I went to the library to find a |
|            thesis topic.             |
|   Then I hung out in front of the    |
|                Dover.                |
|                                      |
|     On the second day of my fall     |
|         semester, I got up.          |
| Then I went to the library to find a |
|            thesis topic.             |
|   Then I hung out in front of the    |
|                Dover.                |
|                                      |
|     On the third day of my fall      |
|         semester, I got up.          |
| Then I went to the library to find a |
|            thesis topic.             |
|       I found a thesis topic:        |
| How to keep people from hanging out  |
|        in front of the Dover.        |
