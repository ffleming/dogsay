|  Half a bee, philosophically, must   |
|       ipso facto half not be.        |
|   But half the bee has got to be,    |
|      vis-a-vis its entity. See?      |
|  But can a bee be said to be or not  |
|         to be an entire bee,         |
| When half the bee is not a bee, due  |
|       to some ancient injury?        |
