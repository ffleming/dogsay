|  A man sank into the psychiatrist's  |
|      couch and said, "I have a       |
|  terrible problem, Doctor. I have a  |
|  son at Harvard and another son at   |
| Princeton; I've just gifted each of  |
|  them with a new Ferrari; I've got   |
| homes in Beverly Hills, Palm Beach,  |
|  and a co-op in New York; and I've   |
|  got a thriving ranch in Venezuela.  |
| My wife is a gorgeous young actress  |
|  who considers my two mistresses to  |
|        be her best friends."         |
|    The psychiatrist looked at the    |
|    patient, confused. "Did I miss    |
| something? It sounds to me like you  |
|      have no problems at all."       |
|   "But, Doctor, I only make $175 a   |
|                week."                |
