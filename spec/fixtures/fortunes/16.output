|  When the Apple IIc was introduced,  |
| the informative copy led off with a  |
|                couple                |
|       of asterisked sentences:       |
|                                      |
|    It weighs less than 8 pounds.*    |
|    And costs less than $1,300.**     |
|                                      |
|   In tiny type were these "fuller    |
|            explanations":            |
|                                      |
|      * Don't asterisks make you      |
| suspicious as all get out? Well, all |
|   this means is that the IIc alone   |
|    weights 7.5 pounds. The power     |
| pack, monitor, an extra disk drive,  |
|     a printer and several bricks     |
|  will make the IIc weigh more. Our   |
|   lawyers were concerned that you    |
|   might not be able to figure this   |
|          out for yourself.           |
|                                      |
| ** The FTC is concerned about price  |
|     fixing. You can pay more if      |
|     you really want to. Or less.     |
