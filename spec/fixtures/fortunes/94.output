|          mentioned before,           |
|   And make errors few people could   |
|                bear;                 |

|         English but yours --         |
|  Do you really think this is quite   |
|                fair?"                |

|          William declared,           |

|         got them all scared,         |
|   And to stop me it's now far too    |
|                late."                |
