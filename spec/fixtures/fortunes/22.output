| As I was walking down the street one |
|         dark and dreary day,         |
| I came upon a billboard and much to  |
|              my dismay,              |
|  The words were torn and tattered,   |
|   From the storm the night before,   |
| The wind and rain had done its work  |
|       and this is how it goes,       |
|                                      |
|   Smoke Coca-Cola cigarettes, chew   |
|       Wrigleys Spearmint beer,       |
|   Ken-L-Ration dog food makes your   |
|          complexion clear,           |
|   Simonize your baby in a Hershey    |
|              candy bar,              |
|  And Texaco's a beauty cream that's  |
|         used by every star.          |
|                                      |
|  Take your next vacation in a brand  |
|           new Frigedaire,            |
|   Learn to play the piano in your    |
|          winter underwear,           |
| Doctors say that babies should smoke |
|         until they're three,         |
|  And people over sixty-five should   |
|         bathe in Lipton tea.         |
